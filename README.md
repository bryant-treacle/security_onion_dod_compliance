    This script will apply Canical Ubuntu 16.04 LTS STIGâ€™s to Security Onion 16.04.5.6 when configured as a Master, Heavy Node, Forward Node, or Storage Node.  If you are running a different release, please choose the branch for that release.  
    
    The deb_packages folder contains all necessary packages and dependencies for use on Air Gapped networks.  If internet access is available, please run SOUP at your earliest convenience to ensure those packages are up-to-date.
    
    This script has been designed to be ran as many times if needed to verify updates or changes to configuration files have not overwritten any STIG requirements.

    A copy of the unclassified STIG Viewer and completed checklist has been included in the Repo.  
    NOTE: The STIG View does require a java runtime environment in order to launch.  

## Login Banner:
    - Add SSH, Web, and Desktop Environment DoD consent banners prior to granting user access to the system.
    - Enforce DoD password policies to local user and Kibana/Sguil/Squert accounts.

## Password Compliance:
    - Enforces DoD Password Policies on any local server account created after the script.
    - Adds Compliance to the following STIG Finding IDs using the Application Security and Development Security Technical Implementation Guide.
    - To change password requirements for the Operating System modify the below line in the '/etc/pam.d/common-passwords file.
         password requisite pam_cracklib.so minlen=15 retry=3 difok=8 ucredit=-2 lcredit=-2 dcredit=-2  ocredit=-2

        - difok: number of characters that must change between the old and new passwords
        - ucredit: Number of uppercase letters required
        - lcredit: Number of lowercase letters required
        - dcredit: Number of digits (numbers) required
        - ocredit: Number of other (Special) characters required
    
    - To change password requirements for Kibana/Sguil/Squert accounts you can modify the number inside the {} curl brackets found after the regex pattern found in /usr/sbin/so-user-add & /usr/sbin/so-user-passwd after the script has been executed. If you want to make the change prior to running the script edit so-user-add-dod & so-user-passwd-dod files located in the files folder within the repository.
    
## Bruteforce account lockout:
    - Enforces DoD brute force account lockout requirements and will remain locked for 30 minutes.  It is strongly recommended to have an "emergency access" account with a complex password that can be used if the admin account is locked due to failed login attempts.  To modify the lockout time modify the following line in /etc/pam.d/common-auth
        auth    required                        pam_tally2.so    onerr=fail deny=3 unlock_time=3600
    - For local server accounts you will need to change to run sudo passwd <locked user> command to re-enable the account.
    - For Kibana/Sguil/Squert accounts you will need to run the so-user-passwd command to re-enable the account.
